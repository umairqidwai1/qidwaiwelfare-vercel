It distributed 400 food packs in various locations in the Thar Desert, 600 food packs in Balochistan, 200 food packs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and 150 food packs in Karachi \u2013 Sindh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the recipients were pre-screened, prior to the distribution by our partner organizations, (Muslim Aid Pakistan &amp; FRDP), and all efforts were made to ensure they were Zakat eligible. Preference was given to poor and needy families of orphans, widows, homeless, unemployed and disabled people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year the bulk of the food distribution was done in remote areas in Balochistan and in the Thar Desert, which are hours away from major cities and only accessible via sand roads, and thus are usually ignored by most other organizations.\u00a0 QWT targeted some of the most underdeveloped areas which have no electricity, gas, running water, sewage, mobile telecommunication coverage, proper schools, clinics or hospitals, and other basic infrastructure. The residents of these areas were mostly living in mud dwellings, and surviving off their small dwindling herds of livestock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2.jpg 600w, https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Qidwai Welfare Trust distributed approximately 67,500kg (148,500 lbs) of food stables to 1,350 Zakat eligible families in some of the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2371,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2364","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-food-distribution"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3.jpg","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p4lWJl-C8","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2364","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2364"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2364\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2376,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2364\/revisions\/2376"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2371"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2364"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2364"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/qidwaiwelfare.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2364"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
